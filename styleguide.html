        <h1>Snobbery</h1>
        <span class="sub-head"> Intellectual and Otherwise</span>
      <p class="section-title"><strong>What Is a Snob?</strong></p><p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>ost of us care about being important, in one way or another. A snob cares about being important in a special way, namely, by being associated with a class of people who garner prestige, glory, or some other kind of supposedly superior wonderfulness. And he cares about his membership in or association with this class comparatively: by way of his association or membership, he is conscious of being better than other people, namely ones outside the class that gives him his sense of importance. So two kinds of “objects” are necessary for snobbery: you need something to be snobbish about, and you need <a href="#">somebody to be snobbish toward.</a></p>
      <p class="section-title"><strong>Species of Snobs</strong></p>
      <p>Let’s look at some examples. Some Episcopalians are church snobs. Their self-esteem gains nourishment from association with a beautiful liturgy, a sophisticated and wealthy membership, and a certain air of antiquarian aestheticism combined with scientific up-to-dateness. From this superior elevation they can look down with delicious understated contempt on the plain-Jane Baptists, the rowdy Pentecostals, and the credulous people of the Bible Churches. Similar things can be said about language snobs, food snobs, music snobs, and many other species of snobs.
      My adult daughter Maria called me a couple of days before Christmas and asked what I was doing. When I told her I was writing an article on snobbery she said, “I think we Robertses are snobs.” I said, “Oh, yes? What do you mean?” She said, “Well, it’s as though there are all those people out there doing all those stupid things, like watching football; and it’s almost everybody else, but we don’t do them.” And she added, “When I think that way, I think it kind of isolates me, and keeps me from doing some things that I might enjoy; when I do them, I feel connected to the people, even though it reduces my sense of specialness.”
      In large part, snobs and their outsiders don’t meet in anything like an encounter in their respective roles. Snobs can be kindhearted toward their outsiders, and seek to keep their snobbery from showing; and the despised outsider may likewise, in the interest of emotional peace and harmony, forbear the snob’s snobbery. They’re aware of one another, but at some distance. As long as this is so, their attitudes toward one another may be tolerant. The despised outsider may even take a bemused attitude toward his snob. But occasionally they do meet in what we might call a snobbery encounter.</p>
      <p><strong>To Snob: A Definition</strong></p><p>Here we feel in need of a verb that doesn’t exist in the required sense in English (according to my search of the OED on line): to snob; though our contemporary ‘to snub’ (etymologically unrelated) comes pretty close. There are various kinds of snobbing. You can get intellectually snobbed, architecturally snobbed, denominationally snobbed, culinarily snobbed, musically snobbed, and so forth.</p>

      <p>Here is an intellectual example. You teach philosophy at a middling state university. In a conversation with a member of the philosophy department at an Ivy League university you say some intelligent things that might affect this philosopher’s work. You would like to be in a continuing dialogue with her about issues of common interest. But you come away feeling that you weren’t “heard,” that your interlocutor hardly “saw” you and certainly won’t remember your name. It could be that you have just experienced being snobbed.</p>
